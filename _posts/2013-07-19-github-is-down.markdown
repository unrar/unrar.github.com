### So, aparently, GitHub is down due to a DDoS. What's the most intelligent thing to do? PANIC! ###
At least it's more intelligent than trying to post in a GitHub blog.
But, while GitHub wasn't there, I've managed to make the blog much more beautiful; with a design based
in some other blogs' ones, but coded by myself.
Do you think it's beautiful? I really do, I can't wait to post and post.

Soon I'll create some post talking about CoffeeScript... 
And, if I can do something to make AGE better, I will also talk about it here. Everybody loves AGE, don't you?

I'm thinking about using AGE in this blog. I probably will, but since at the moment there are no cookies (**that's an upcoming feature**) it's a bit useless. So that's what I am going to work with; adding cookies to the verification system. I'd add the
verifications in the `default.html` layout, but since it should check your cookies, it should only ask you for your age say,
two hours after you verified it. Of course, if you don't pass the age verification, you'll have to delete the cookie unless you
want to wait 2 hours :P

Thanks for reading!
