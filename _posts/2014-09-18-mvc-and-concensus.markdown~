### We had a site for [TwentyPeople International](http://twentypeopleinternational.blogspot.com). Now, say hello to [TwentyPeople Europe](http://unrar.github.io/tpe)'s! ###

Although TPI's site was just a Blogspot blog (they don't have a developer at all), it worked. I'm not going to explain how TwentyPeople Europe/Int. works here, I will soon. But you should know that TPE is the group of developers that make **products** that TPI **distributes** through GitHub.

So, me being the "chief of developers" at TPE and the "TPE Developers' Leader" at TPI, decided that it's time to have a site for TPE. Yes, TPI's site is the important one to "sell" products, because they're the distributors. But we, as a developers community, also owe a site! 
That's why our new site (linked always in the sidebar) is focused in *freedom*. The biggest text claims that all our products are free. Well, that's totally true and it's not big news, even though it's our **motto**. We focus on **freedom**.
Yes, TPI has licenses for non-free (gratis/libre) products, but that's another story. All what we develop is going to be freely distributed, granted!

If you want to join TwentyPeople Europe, just mail me!

I hope you enjoy the new site! (Don't try to click at the navbar links, they don't work yet :P)
