Welcome to my new Jekyll blog!

I just switched from GitHub Pages to Jekyll, mainly because UnBot is a dead project. Also, I just have a [Linux-focused blog](http://www.catbuntu.me) and of course the [TPI](http://twentypeopleinternational.blogspot.com) blog, so a blog on programming would be great!

I will try to talk you a bit about what am I doing and other stuff here.

I hope you enjoy my blog!
