{"name":"UnBot","tagline":"UnBot's Official Page","google":"","body":"# UnRar's UnBot\r\nUnRar's UnBot is an IRC bot project mainly designed to interact with Wikipedia, using MediaWiki's API. It's widely used on the #wikipedia-es and #wikipedia-es-bots, but can be ported to other languages or projects. It's proudly hosted by ClumsyFairyQueen's server.\r\n\r\nYou're free to download or fork a copy of UnBot, and port it to another project, by Wikimedia or by you; or to just fork the bot and adapt it to whatever you use. Please note that I'll only support the \"main\" UnBot, so if you modify something and have a problem with, let's say, the %ip command, I won't support it.\r\n\r\nTo \"clone\" the actual UnBot, run the following command:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ git clone\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can have your clone always up-to-date by using this command on the directory you cloned:\r\n```\r\n$ git pull\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Branches\r\nWe actually have 2 branches:\r\n* **master** - It's the branch for **Sybil** (actual stable-frozen).\r\n* **shiva** - Branch for the **Shiva** (testing) development.\r\n\r\nIn the future, we'll add more branches for the old-stable version, the unstable version...\r\n\r\n### Release schedule\r\nWe use a Debian-like release schedule. There are always a **stable** version, an **unstable** version and a **testing** version. They have a codename, actually **Sybil** (frozen), **Peggy** and **Shiva**. The unstable version shouldn't be used and its name will be always **Peggy**.\r\n\r\nThere are also \"modifiers\" for the releases. There's a **stable-frozen** version, currently Sybil. Being frozen means it won't be more longer supported, thus there won't be more bug fixes and no more issues will be solved. This status is used transitionally meanwhile we change from **stable** to **testing**. During the frozen or transition stage, we focus on the **testing** version, and to convert it to **stable**. Once it reached the **stable** status, the old **stable-frozen** version changes its codename and has the **old-stable** status. The old-stable releases aren't supported, but still avaliable to download or fork.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nThe main development of both Sybil and Shiva is being done by me, UnRar (Catbuntu). There're also loads of help from the StackOverflow guys and from Freenode IRC channels.\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nIf you find a bug or an issue, you can track it with GitHub's Issues. You can contact me on [my mail](catbuntu@catbuntu.me) or at Freenode.","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
